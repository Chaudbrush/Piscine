## About
Sharing my personal progress and experience with 42 School Piscine, which started 20th January 2025 and ended 14th February 2025. Had close to none experience before joining, it was a challenging, demanding and fulfilling month. Everything I did during Piscine is in the [DuringPiscine](https://github.com/Chaudbrush/Piscine/tree/main/DuringPiscine). After finishing the Piscine I came back for some exercises I wanted to complete, they are in the [AfterPiscine](https://github.com/Chaudbrush/Piscine/tree/main/AfterPiscine) folder.

### Piscine
The "piscine" is a unique and intense coding boot camp-style program offered by 42 School. The term "piscine" is French for "swimming pool," which metaphorically refers to diving into a challenging and immersive learning experience. During the piscine, participants, often prospective students of 42 School, are given a condensed period, typically a few weeks, to fully immerse themselves in coding and problem-solving tasks.

The piscine serves as an entry point and selection process for 42 School's full curriculum. It's designed to evaluate candidates' coding skills, determination, and ability to handle the rigorous and collaborative learning style that 42 School employs. The challenges presented during the piscine range in complexity, requiring participants to work on various coding projects and exercises.

Participating in the piscine is a way for candidates to showcase their coding abilities, learn about 42 School's unique learning environment, and earn a spot in the full program if they complete the challenges and demonstrate the required aptitude.
